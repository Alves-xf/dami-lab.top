  abstract = {We assembled a semi-automated reconstruction of L2/3 mouse primary visual cortex from {$\sim$}250~\texttimes{} 140~\texttimes{} 90~{$\mu$}m3 of electron microscopic images, including pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and precursors, pericytes, vasculature, nuclei, mitochondria, and synapses. Visual responses of a subset of pyramidal cells are included. The data are publicly available, along with tools for programmatic and three-dimensional interactive access. Brief vignettes illustrate the breadth of potential applications relating structure to function in cortical circuits and neuronal cell biology. Mitochondria and synapse organization are characterized as a function of path length from the soma. Pyramidal connectivity motif frequencies are predicted accurately using a configuration model of random graphs. Pyramidal cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger and more reliable visual responses. Sample code shows data access and analysis.},
