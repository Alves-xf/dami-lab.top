We are a group of people sharing interests in cutting-edge technologies and brain sciences.

* We develop new computational methods for analyzing data;
* We propose and verify new hypotheses to explain observed phenomenon from data;
* We build new artificial neural networks inspired by brain computation theories.

Data is the core of the DAMI research and we are open to all potential collaborations with experimental neuroscientists on cool datasets.
